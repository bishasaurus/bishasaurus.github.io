<p>This is a Overwatch fan site, where you can rate your team's competence. The app takes the team's damaging, healing, tanking and other attributes into account, and gives a review of its potential. You can then save your reviewed teams, and see their and other saved teams' rating again from the <a style="color:orange;" href="saved-teams.php">Saved teams</a> -page. You can delete saved teams from <a style="color:orange;" href="manage-teams.php">Manage teams</a> -page. You can also create an account in the  <a style="color:orange;" href="login-page.php">Sign up</a> -page, and login afterwards via <a style="color:orange;" href="login-page2.php">Login & Account</a> -page. <br><br> Hope you can create good team compositions with Overwatch Team Rater!</p>
